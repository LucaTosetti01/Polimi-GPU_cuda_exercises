# GPU CUDA Exercises

Lab exercises and exams for the "GPU & Heterogeneous systems" course 2023/2024 @ Polimi. \
Prof: Antonio Miele Rosario.

This repository contains several CUDA exercise proposed by the professor during the course and several exams with my personal solutions, you can check them by browsing the branches.
